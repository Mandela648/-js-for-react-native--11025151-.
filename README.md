## Student ID: <11025151>

### Task 1:
- **File:** `arrayManipulation.js`
- **Description:** Created a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2:
- **File:** `arrayManipulation.js`
- **Description:** Added a function `formatArrayStrings` that takes two arrays as arguments (an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`). The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the string if the number is even and converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3:
- **File:** `userInfo.js`
- **Description:** Created a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and an array of modified names, and returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 4:
- **File:** `README.md`
- **Description:** Added a README file containing the student ID and a brief explanation of each task. Committed each task separately.
